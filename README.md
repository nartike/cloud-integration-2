# student-server
TP2 for the Cloud integration class. 

The goal is simply to have a code that can run on a pipeline with GitHub Actions and auto-compile, test and build an image. <br>
The focus for the teacher is to help us have a good vision about using pipelines and being enterprise-ready by using the features like branches, issues and PR. <br>
I think I already know a bit of this based on the fact that I already work as an apprentice so I will take some shortcuts and avoid creating issues / branches for some things. <br>
